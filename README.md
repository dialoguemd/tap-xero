## Running the tap

1) Create config file with the following variables and store it at `./config.json`:
```
{
  "client_id": "SECRET",
  "client_secret": "SECRET",
  "tenant_id": "SECRET",
  "refresh_token": "GENERATED BY NOTEBOOK",
  "start_date": "2000-01-01"
}
```

1.1) The secrets are all stored in 1Password in the Analytics DB Credentials Vault

1.2) Using those secrets and the jupyter notebook called `get_initial_xero_tokens`, run through the web-based auth process to get your initial refresh token. Using this token the tap will then chain your tokens and will be able to run on its own. You must use the notebook manually before every run of the tap. See more on this OAuth protocol [here](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/oauth2/auth-flow).

2) Run `poetry update` to ensure dependencies are up to date

3) Run `poetry install` to add these to your machine

4) Run `poetry shell` to enter the virtual environment from which you can run tap-xero

5) Run `python dia_tap_xero/__init__.py -c config.json -p properties.json > out.json` to run this tap to an output json file

5.1) Run `python dia_tap_xero/__init__.py -c config.json -p properties.json | target-postgres -c config_postgres.json` to run this tap to a table in a postgres DB. Ensure that singer-target-postgres is installed to do this and ensure that as to its spec, your config_postgres.json is properly configured.


#### NOTE:
Xero has an API limit of 5000 calls per day and 60 calls per second. We have not hit the daily threshold yet, but do keep it in mind.
